# protest-app-1

Protesting, or the way organizers are publicly making their opinions heard by the public influence is a direct way people are trying to enact change. Our group thought that with everything happening in our society we should make an app to help these protests be more organized. Our solution was to design an app where people sign up anonymously, in order to protect their identity, and through our app will then be directed to find a protest near them.

ProtestApp was built using React-Native (coded in Javascript), Google Maps API, GeoCoder module for front end. Backend handled via FireBase. 

Project finished as a finalist at Hack'20
